###  Codoku -  What is it?
Codoku is the world’s fastest way for building static websites.
Codoku is commonly used by people and organizations for maintaining documentation, 
tutorials, wikis or guides. Codoku is perfect for your next project.
 
### What makes Codoku special?
 
Codoku says NO to dependencies. Codoku doesn't require any special static website generators 
or a gazillion npm dependencies. It works out of the box.
Codoku also comes packed with a development server so you can instantly get started.
The only thing you need is a browser and a text editor. 
Codoku doesn't require an extra build step. 


### How well does it scale?

Codoku will scale to practically infinite pages as the contents are lazy loaded 
and unlike other static website generators, 
it doesn't have to go through an extra build step to generate those thousand or so pages.

Well, it comes with full markdown support, syntax highlighting and a development server.
